# Welcome to my Github Page! ðŸ‘‹

Here is a little overview on my repositories and my plans for future projects.

## Competitions
From time to time I am planning the participation in some Hackertons and co. The repositories are linked below.

## ML, DL Experiments

In these Repository I want to gain experiences in different Algorithms. I haven't yet started with many of the projects, so the following list is used as a list of possible ideas. When started, I will link the repositories or parts to the list :) </br>

  | RL-ly Fun (planned) | Repository for Implementation of Deep-Reinforcement Learning with focus on sample Efficiency |planned | Implementation and Comparison of <ul><li>DDPG</li><li>TP3</li><li>SAC and variations</li></ul>
  | NLP Experiments (planned) | Repository for Implementation of NLP algorithms. | planned | <ul><li>Using and adapt BERT</li><li>Language Generation using GAN?</li><li>Reininforcement Learning in NLP</li></ul>


## University related

Below repositories are listed, which were created for university purposes. This also lists projects listed by group members.

  | Name   | Task | Year | Description
  |:---:   | :---: |  :---: | :---
  | [Fallstudie](https://github.com/sukram42/Fallstudie) | Design and implementation of a business simulation game | 2016-2017 | The task was to create a business simulation game, in which different players can run a company and compete against each other.
  | [Background Jobs on mobile](https://github.com/sukram42/mobile1_pfisterer_backgroundjobs)| Minimum Example of using background jobs in mobile software engineering | 2017-2018 | The task was to create a minimum example and sufficient explanation on background jobs in mobile development.
  | [The Mondaypainters](https://github.com/TimMaa/project-bladerunner)| Creation of an application which shows the use case of the __Cassandra__ database. | 2017-2018 | Within this course we needed to showcase a database of our choice. We chose the __Cassandra__. Eventually we build a highly-scalable app to play the Mondaypainters with a huge amount of people. We based our idea on the [**Reddit Place Experiment**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_(Reddit))
  | [Sample-Efficiency in RL](https://github.com/davelbit/DTU-RL-Sample-Efficiency) | Implementation and Anylsis of the SAC algorithm. | 2020-2021 | Implementation of the Soft-Actor-Critic Deep-Reinforcement-Learning from scratch and analysis of different hyperparameter
