## Hi, I'm Markus ðŸ‘‹

I'm an team lead with a passion for building robust, scalable, and ethical AI solutions that drive real-world impact. My background includes experience in developing and leading complex machine learning systems. And I love playing around with tech and solve my own problems using tech.

### What I Do

*   **AI Strategy & Execution:** I guide and empower teams in developing and implementing cutting-edge AI applications across various domains.
*   **Full-Stack AI/ML Development:** I bring a practical, hands-on approach to the entire AI lifecycle, from data exploration and model building to deployment and monitoring.
*   **Building Scalable Systems:** I specialize in architecting and implementing production-ready AI systems that can handle real-world data volumes and traffic.
*   **Bridging the Gap:** I leverage my software engineering foundation to bridge the gap between data science research and robust, maintainable code.

### What You'll Find Here
This GitHub profile showcases some of my personal projects, experiments, and contributions to the open-source community. I'm particularly interested in AI/ML, fullstack development and everything else I want to try out.

I'm always eager to connect with fellow engineers to discuss the latest advancements in AI and SE. Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out â€“ let's talk tech!

Here you can find an exerpt of my private hobby projects of the last years:

Then I was starting using GenAI for the formulation of paragraphs. Outlaine provides a specialized UI exactly for this. | TypeScript, Supabase, ReactJS, Vite, LLMs | 
  | [Orophilia a.k.a Peaks'n'tracks](https://github.com/sukram42/orophilia) | A platform to explore new ambitious mountaintops by ascent difficulty | 2023 - 2024 | I love hiking and climbing mountains. Hence, I wanted to create a platform to allow for filtering based on the hiking difficult scale (T1-T6). Heavily inspired by the wonderful forum [Hikr](https://www.hikr.org) | Typescript, Supabase, ReactJS
  | [Orophilia a.k.a Peaks'n'tracks Crawler](https://github.com/sukram42/orophilia-crawler) | A platform to explore new ambitious mountaintops by ascent difficulty | 2023 - 2024 | The crawler for the Orophilia platform. | Python, Sklearn, Overpass, Open Street Map, Supabase
   | [Genflix](https://sukram42.github.io/genflix/) [[Deployment](https://sukram42.github.io/genflix/)] |Tool to explore the hidden genres of Netlix |2021| Netflix has a big number of genres which they do not show. With Genflix I want to make them more accessible :) | VueJS, Typescript 
  | [arXis-analyzer](https://github.com/sukram42/arXiv-analyser)| Little tool to analyze the popularity of certain research topics  | 2021 | It gives information about the number of posted papers on arXis.org based on certain topics. (e.g anomaly detection with and on graphs) | Python
  | [Fun with GAN](https://github.com/sukram42/project-fun-with-GAN) | Repository for GAN Networks |2021| <ul><li>GAN on MNIST</li><li>Conditioned GAN on MNIST</li><li>Analyse of latent state of GAN (planned)</li><li>GAN for Time Series Anomaly Detection</li><li>Compression using GAN or VAEs? </li><li>Neural Processes</li><li>GAN on Graphs</li></ul> | Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow
  | [Neural Processes](https://github.com/sukram42/NeuralProcesses)| Experimenting with the idea Neural Processes | 2021 | The paper [Neural Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01622) by Marta Garnelo was one of the most fascinating paper for me. I created this repository to explore and fully understand these. | Python, PyTorch
  | [RL-ly Fun](https://github.com/sukram42/project-RL-Fun)  | Repository for Implementation of Deep-Reinforcement Learning with focus on sample Efficiency |2021 | Implementation and Comparison of <ul><li>DDPG</li><li>TP3</li><li>SAC and variations</li></ul> | Python, PyTorch
  | NLP Experiments (planned) | Repository for Implementation of NLP algorithms. | planned | <ul><li>Using and adapt BERT</li><li>Language Generation using GAN?</li><li>Reininforcement Learning in NLP</li></ul>
| Graph DL | Implementation of a Deep Learning algorithms on graph data. |planned| <ul><li>GNN from Scratch</li><li>GNN For Image classification</li></ul>
